#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It entails, software product design, testing, deployment and maintenance. Software engineering is important in modern day activities in various sectors as: communication, commerce, health care and enternainment industries. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Early computing and programming, development of the first programmable computes such as ENIAC and UNIVAC, the first inventions were created for use during the second world war. It led to the creating and development of one of the first programming languages, the Assembly language.

2. Software engineering as a discipline. In a NATO conferece in 1968, the term software engineering was first used and the groundwork to laying the foundation of Software engineering as a discipline began.

3. Oject Orient Programming, this was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s and led to the creation of some programming languages such as Java, C++ and Small talk.

4. Software as a Service (SaaS) and Cloud Computing in the 2000sThe emergence of cloud computing platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Services in 2006) and the SaaS model.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Planning Stage- Planning for an upcoming project and identifying problems and scope of existing systems, determaination of the new system's objectives.Securing resorces to make the plan happen
2) Requirements- The analysis stage includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes.Developers may:

Define any prototype system requirements
Evaluate alternatives to existing prototypes
Perform research and analysis to determine the needs of end-users
Furthermore, developers will often create a software requirement specification or SRS document.
This includes all the specifications for software, hardware, and network requirements for the system they plan to build. This will prevent them from overdrawing funding or resources when working at the same place as other development teams.

3) Design-Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as its:

User interfaces
System interfaces
Network and network requirements
Databases

4) Software development:The development stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications.
Developers will follow any coding guidelines as defined by the organization and utilize different tools such as compilers, debuggers, and interpreters.

Programming languages can include staples such as C++, PHP, and more. Developers will choose the right programming code to use based on the project specifications and requirements.

5) Testing-During the testing stage, developers will go over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested.

It’s important that the software overall ends up meeting the quality standards that were previously defined in the SRS document.

6) Implementation: After testing, the overall design for the software will come together. Different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, usually by leveraging training environments to detect further errors or defects.
   
7) Maintenance- The SDLC doesn’t end when software reaches the market. Developers must now move into maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users.

   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next, making it suitable for projects with clear, unchanging requirements (e.g., construction projects).

Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous adaptation and customer feedback throughout the project, ideal for environments with evolving requirements (e.g., software development for startups).

Waterfall emphasizes documentation and predictability but is less adaptable to changes, leading to potential issues if requirements shift after the initial phases.

Agile focuses on delivering working software quickly with less emphasis on documentation, enabling early value delivery and continuous improvement.

Use Waterfall for projects with fixed scopes and Agile for dynamic, customer-driven projects that require ongoing adjustments.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer

Project Manager
Roles and Responsibilities:

Planning: Define project scope, create timelines, allocate resources, and develop project plans.
Coordination: Facilitate communication between team members, stakeholders, and clients to ensure alignment on goals and progress.
Risk Management: Identify potential risks, develop mitigation strategies, and adjust project plans as needed.
Monitoring: Track the project's progress against milestones, manage budgets, and ensure that the project stays on schedule.
Reporting: Provide regular updates to stakeholders on project status, issues, and changes, ensuring transparency throughout the project lifecycle.
Each role is essential for delivering high-quality software on time
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes
Challenge: Staying current with evolving technologies.
Strategy: Continuously learn through courses, engage in developer communities, and focus on fundamental principles.
2. Managing Complexity
Challenge: Handling complex systems and technical debt.
Strategy: Use modular design, adopt best practices, and regularly refactor to simplify code.
3. Dealing with Unclear or Changing Requirements
Challenge: Managing scope creep and frequent changes.
Strategy: Implement Agile, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and use prototypes to clarify requirements.
4. Time Management and Meeting Deadlines
Challenge: Balancing tasks and meeting deadlines.
Strategy: Prioritize tasks, use time management tools, and focus on one task at a time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing
   - What It Is:Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
   - Importance:Detects bugs early and ensures code quality.

2. Integration Testing
   - What It Is: Tests the interaction between integrated components.
   - Importance: Catches issues when modules interact, ensuring smooth integration.

 3. System Testing
   - What It Is: Tests the complete system to verify it meets requirements.
   - Importance:Validates end-to-end functionality from a user’s perspective.

4. Acceptance Testing
   - What It Is: Tests if the software is ready for delivery to users.
   - Importance: Confirms the software meets business needs and is fit for release.



Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is creating systems that can perform tasks with human intelligence. It's iportance in AI models is that it improves responces from AI search engines and models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague Prompt:
"Create a report about our sales."

Improved Prompt:
"Create a 2-page report on Q2 sales performance, including a comparison with Q1, highlighting key trends, and providing recommendations for Q3."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it is:
- Clear: Specifies exactly what is needed (a report on Q2 sales performance).
- Specific:Details what the report should include (comparison with Q1, key trends, recommendations).
- Concise:Communicates the requirements in a straightforward manner without unnecessary details.

This clarity helps the recipient understand the task fully, reduces ambiguity, and ensures the final output meets the expectations.
